## Image Management
### Naming Convention
Format: `[brand-]product-name-size.[extension]`

Examples:
- `rina-cooking-oil-1l.jpg`
- `softcare-diapers-small-48pcs.jpg`
- `red-bull-250ml.jpg`

### Image Guidelines
- Use lowercase letters only
- Replace spaces with hyphens
- Include brand name if applicable
- Include size/quantity information
- Supported formats: .jpg, .png, .webp
- Maximum file size: 5MB
- Recommended dimensions: 400x400px minimum

## Price Calculation
All prices are calculated from wholesale prices with the formula:
\`\`\`
Individual Price = (Wholesale Price Ã· Quantity) + KES 5
\`\`\`

Example:
- Wholesale: "Velvex Toilet Cleaner 6x1L = KES 2200"
- Individual: (2200 Ã· 6) + 5 = KES 372

- `POST /api/products` - Create new product
- `PUT /api/products/[id]` - Update product
